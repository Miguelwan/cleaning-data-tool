**Load a dataset**: This option allows you to load a dataset.

Otherwise your work on the first dataset will be lost. Currently only dataset with an extension csv or xlsx are supported.

#### Load a dataset

In this option you will be asked about the extension of the file (currently only csv and xlsx are supported) and the name of the file (without extension). In case the extension of the dataset is csv, you will be asked about the separator of the dataset. In case the extension of the dataset is xlsx, you will be asked about the name of the sheet.

#### Export the dataset

In this option you will be asked about the extension (currently only csv and xlsx are supported) and name for the new file.
